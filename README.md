# Stream Processing Library for Java (RSP4J)


In this repository, the following projects are present:

* [API](./api/Readme.md), which contains the interfaces and abstractions required to develop your stream processor engine.
* [yasper](./yasper/README.md), which contains some reference implementations that aims at showing the API usage by providing examples (Currently a relational and a graph example)

A [step-by-step guide](./quickstart/Step-by-step-guide.md) can be found in the quickstart module.

An [Official Documentation](rsp4j-documentation.md) is also available for an in-depth explenation on the various components and the examples provided.
